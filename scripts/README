Useful shell scripts for exec (F2).

Copy these scripts to a bin directory to install. Better yet, add this scripts
directory to your $PATH.

These scripts attempt to automagically do the right thing by checking the
values of the exported env variables: $f and $s. If there are selected text
they will use it as input otherwise the current file will be used as input.
